Protein homolog models detect a protein sequence based on its similarity to a curated reference sequence. A protein homolog model has only one parameter: a curated BLASTP bitscore cutoff for determining the strength of a match. Protein homolog model matches to reference sequences are categorized on three criteria: \"perfect\", \"strict\" and \"loose\". A perfect match is 100% identical to the reference sequence along its entire length; a strict match is not identical but the bitscore of the matched sequence is greater than the curated BLASTP bitscore cutoff. Loose matches are other sequences with a match bitscore less than the curated BLASTP bitscore.","model_param":{"blastp_bit_score":{"param_type":"BLASTP bit-score","param_description":"A score is a numerical value that describes the overall quality of an alignment with higher numbers correspond to higher similarity. The bit-score (S) is determined by the following formula: S = (\u03bb \u00d7 S \u2212 lnK)\/ ln2 where \u03bb is the Gumble distribution constant, S is the raw alignment score, and K is a constant associated with the scoring matrix. Many AMR detection models use this parameter, including the protein homolog and protein variant models. The BLASTP bit-score parameter is a curated value determined from BLASTP analysis of the canonical reference sequence of a specific AMR-associated protein against the database of CARD reference sequence. This value establishes a threshold for computational prediction of a specific protein amongst a batch of submitted sequences.","param_type_id":"40725","param_value":"575"}},"model_sequences":{"sequence":{"1188":{"protein_sequence":{"accession":"ACT97415.1","sequence":"MKAYFIAILTLFTCIATVVRAQQMSELENRIDSLLNGKKATVGIAVWTDKGDMLRYNDHVHFPLLSVFKFHVALAVLDKMDKQSISLDSIVSIKASQMPPNTYSPLRKKFPDQDFTITLRELMQYSISQS
